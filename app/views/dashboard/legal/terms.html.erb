          <h5>B. Account Terms</h5>

          <p class="my-4"><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>A human must create your account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address. You alone are responsible for your account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your account. You are responsible for keeping your account secure.</em></p>

          <h6>1. Required Information</h6>

          <p>To signin in to our services you will need a myAdventist Account. Your myAdventist account must have a valid email address and your real name. When signing in to our services we collect your general details (i.e. - email, first name, last name) from myAdventist to store.&nbsp;</p>

          	<li>You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young webmasters get excited by managing a website, we must comply with Australian law. Adventist Media does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service.

          	<li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. Adventist Media cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</li>
          	<li>You will promptly notify Adventist Media if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your account, including any unauthorized use of your password or account.</li>
          </ul>

          <h6>4. Additional Terms</h6>

          <p class="my-4"><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close accounts if we need to.</em></p>

          <h6>1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content</h6>
          <p>You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service.

We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.</p>

          <h6>2. Adventist Media May Remove Content</h6>
          <p>We do not pre-screen User-Generated Content, but we have the right (though not the obligation) to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any Adventist Media terms or policies.</p>

          <h6>3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants</h6>
          <p>You retain ownership of and responsibility for Content you create or own (&quot;Your Content&quot;).

          <p>Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us &mdash; and other Adventist Media Users &mdash; certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting Adventist Media the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers.</p>

          <h6>4. License Grant to Us</h6>
          <p>We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service. This includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.</p>

          <h6>5. Moral Rights</h6>
          <p>You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.</p>
          <p>To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant Adventist Media the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.</p>

          <p class="my-4"><strong>Short version:</strong> <em>We do not generally prohibit use of Adventist Media for advertising. However, we expect our users to follow certain limitations, so Adventist Media does not become a spam haven. No one wants that.</em></p>

          <p>We will not delete Content that you have contributed to hosted sites.</p>
          <p>Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing account contents after account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.</p>
